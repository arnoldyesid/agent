- Zero dates achieved acceptable performance (>=80%)

CURRENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
- Simulation Trades: 6,799,441

- Current Accuracy: 0.2131%

PRIMARY ISSUE: MASSIVE OVER-TRADING
Your algorithm is executing far too many trades. This is the #1 problem to fix.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY:

1. REDUCE TRADE FREQUENCY (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Current: 6,799,441 trades -> Target: <50,000 trades
   - Add minimum price movement threshold (e.g., 0.1% change required)
   - Implement trade cooldown periods (e.g., 30-60 seconds between trades)
   - Expected Impact: 90% reduction in trades, 10x improvement in accuracy

SPIKEADDITION PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION:
- Current $25 threshold may be too restrictive or too lenient
- Test with $10, $15, $20 thresholds for better matching
- Consider dynamic thresholds based on market volatility""",

MOMENTUM INDICATORS

1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
   - Purpose: Identify overbought/oversold conditions
   - Range: 0-100 (>70 overbought, <30 oversold)
   - Best For: Ranging markets, divergence spotting
   - Settings: 14-period standard, 9 for scalping, 21 for position trading

2. Bollinger Bands
   - Components: 20 SMA +/- 2 standard deviations
   - Squeeze: Low volatility precedes breakout
   - Walk the Bands: Strong trends ride upper/lower bands
   - Mean Reversion: 95% of price within bands""",

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

Key Concepts:
- Support: Price level where buying pressure exceeds selling
- Resistance: Price level where selling pressure exceeds buying
- Role Reversal: Support becomes resistance and vice versa
- Strength: More touches = stronger level

Identification Methods:
1. Horizontal Levels: Previous highs/lows, psychological numbers
2. Trend Lines: Connect swing highs or lows
3. Moving Averages: Dynamic support/resistance""",
