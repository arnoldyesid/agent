# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a cryptocurrency trading analysis agent that compares real trading data with simulation data to identify price discrepancies. The agent uses GPT-4o through LangChain to provide intelligent analysis of trading inconsistencies.

## Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env file with:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always activate virtual environment first
source env/bin/activate

# ‚ö° STREAMLINED: Lightning-Fast Agent (Only option - optimized and focused)
# Step 1: Preprocess data ONCE (may take 5-15 minutes)
python improved_preprocess_data.py

# Step 2: Run fast agent (instant responses with deep analysis!)
python run_fast_agent.py
```

## Data Structure

- **Real Data**: `data/agent_live_data.csv` - Contains actual trading records
- **Simulation Data**: `data/HL_btcusdt_BTC/*.pickle` - Daily simulation files (June 2025)
- **Metadata**: `data/HL_btcusdt_BTC/metadata.json` - Configuration for data processing

The simulation data uses a master/slave setup (FUTURE/SPOT) for BTC/USDT trading pairs.

## ‚ö° Streamlined Workflow (Optimized Performance)

### Step 1: Enhanced One-Time Preprocessing (5-15 minutes)
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python improved_preprocess_data.py
```
**What this does:**
- Performs advanced analysis with granular accuracy reporting
- Supports YES/NO/PARTIAL verdicts for nuanced assessment
- Detects temporal overlaps and provides comprehensive diagnostics
- Calculates validation results with multiple tolerance levels
- Generates business intelligence insights and recommendations
- Saves detailed results to `analysis_results/` directory

### Step 2: Enhanced Fast Agent (Instant deep responses)
```bash
python run_fast_agent.py
```
**Enhanced Benefits:**
- ‚ö° Instant responses with deep analysis
- üß† Zero RAM consumption during use
- üéØ Granular accuracy assessment (not just binary)
- üîç Advanced pattern recognition and diagnostics
- üíº Business intelligence and actionable recommendations
- üìä Comprehensive trade matching insights

### Example Enhanced Fast Agent Session:
```
‚ö° Fast Agent: Is my simulation accurate?
‚ùå OVERALL SIMULATION ACCURACY: NO (61.3%)
‚Ä¢ Grade: C (Fair) - Major Improvements Required
‚Ä¢ Successful Dates: 19/31 (61.3%)
‚Ä¢ Average Execution Accuracy: 61.3%
‚Ä¢ Key Issue: 12 dates with complete system failures

‚ö° Fast Agent: Analyze discrepancies for 22-06-2025
‚úÖ 22-06-2025 DEEP ANALYSIS: YES (100.0%)
‚Ä¢ Trade Pattern Analysis: 1,913 perfect matches
‚Ä¢ Timing Patterns: Average latency -1.0s (excellent)
‚Ä¢ Business Intelligence: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Consider scaling up on similar conditions
```

## Optimal Usage Patterns

### Memory-Efficient Queries (Use These First)
- **PnL Analysis**: "Calculate my total PnL" ‚Üí Uses `CalculatePnL` (cached data only)
- **Trade Statistics**: "Show me real trade statistics" ‚Üí Uses `GetRealTradeStatistics` (cached data only)  
- **Trade Analysis**: "Analyze my real trading performance" ‚Üí Uses `AnalyzeRealTrades` (cached data only)
- **Data Overview**: "Show me available dates" ‚Üí Uses `GetAvailableDates` (instant)
- **Technical Details**: "Explain validation process" ‚Üí Uses `ExplainValidationProcess` (instant)

### Targeted Analysis (Loads Specific Data)
- **Single Date**: "Analyze discrepancies for 10-06-2025" ‚Üí Uses `AnalyzeSpecificDate` (loads 1 simulation file)
- **Data Preview**: "Preview simulation data for 15-06-2025" ‚Üí Uses `PreviewData` (loads 1 simulation file)

### Heavy Operations (Use Sparingly)
- **Full Analysis**: "Analyze all discrepancies" ‚Üí Uses `AnalyzeDiscrepancies` (loads all 19 simulation files)

### Performance Tips
- Start with real-trade analysis for quick insights
- Use specific dates when comparing real vs simulation
- Cache is persistent across sessions - data loads only once
- Use `ClearCache` if you need to force data reload
