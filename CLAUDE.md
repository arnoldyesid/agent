# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a cryptocurrency trading analysis system that compares real trading data with simulation data to identify price discrepancies. The system processes data and provides access via MCP (Model Context Protocol) connector for Claude at https://claude.ai/settings/connectors.

## Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env file with:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always activate virtual environment first
source env/bin/activate

# Step 1: Preprocess data ONCE (may take 5-15 minutes)
python3 improved_preprocess_data.py

# Step 2: Start MCP server for Claude access
python3 trading_analysis_api.py

# Step 3: Get MCP connector paths for Claude setup
python3 show_mcp_paths.py
```

## Architecture

Simplified MCP-based architecture for Claude integration:

   - Supports YES/NO/PARTIAL verdicts for nuanced assessment
   - Better temporal overlap detection and diagnostics
   - Improved matching criteria with multiple tolerance levels
   - Comprehensive business intelligence insights
   - Saves detailed validation results to JSON files

2. **trading_analysis_api.py**: MCP server providing Claude access:
   - HTTP API server with 7 analysis endpoints
   - Real-time access to preprocessing results
   - JSON-formatted responses for Claude integration
   - Automatic path configuration for MCP setup

   - Verifies required files and dependencies

## Data Structure

- **Real Data**: `data/agent_live_data.csv` - Contains actual trading records
- **Simulation Data**: `data/HL_btcusdt_BTC/*.pickle` - Daily simulation files (June 2025)
- **Metadata**: `data/HL_btcusdt_BTC/metadata.json` - Configuration for data processing

The simulation data uses a master/slave setup (FUTURE/SPOT) for BTC/USDT trading pairs.

## ⚡ Streamlined Workflow (Optimized Performance)

### Step 1: Enhanced One-Time Preprocessing (5-15 minutes)
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python improved_preprocess_data.py
```
**What this does:**
- Performs advanced analysis with granular accuracy reporting
- Supports YES/NO/PARTIAL verdicts for nuanced assessment
- Detects temporal overlaps and provides comprehensive diagnostics
- Calculates validation results with multiple tolerance levels
- Generates business intelligence insights and recommendations
- Saves detailed results to `analysis_results/` directory

### Step 2: Enhanced Fast Agent (Instant deep responses)
```bash
python run_fast_agent.py
```
**Enhanced Benefits:**
- ⚡ Instant responses with deep analysis
- 🧠 Zero RAM consumption during use
- 🎯 Granular accuracy assessment (not just binary)
- 🔍 Advanced pattern recognition and diagnostics
- 💼 Business intelligence and actionable recommendations
- 📊 Comprehensive trade matching insights

### Example Enhanced Fast Agent Session:
```
⚡ Fast Agent: Is my simulation accurate?
❌ OVERALL SIMULATION ACCURACY: NO (61.3%)
• Grade: C (Fair) - Major Improvements Required
• Successful Dates: 19/31 (61.3%)
• Average Execution Accuracy: 61.3%
• Key Issue: 12 dates with complete system failures

⚡ Fast Agent: Analyze discrepancies for 22-06-2025
✅ 22-06-2025 DEEP ANALYSIS: YES (100.0%)
• Trade Pattern Analysis: 1,913 perfect matches
• Timing Patterns: Average latency -1.0s (excellent)
• Business Intelligence: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE
• Recommendation: Consider scaling up on similar conditions
```

## Key Implementation Details

### ⚡ Fast Architecture Features (RECOMMENDED)
- **Advanced Trade Matching**: 5-second time window with price/quantity proximity scoring

## Optimal Usage Patterns

### Memory-Efficient Queries (Use These First)
- **PnL Analysis**: "Calculate my total PnL" → Uses `CalculatePnL` (cached data only)
- **Trade Statistics**: "Show me real trade statistics" → Uses `GetRealTradeStatistics` (cached data only)  
- **Trade Analysis**: "Analyze my real trading performance" → Uses `AnalyzeRealTrades` (cached data only)
- **Data Overview**: "Show me available dates" → Uses `GetAvailableDates` (instant)
- **Technical Details**: "Explain validation process" → Uses `ExplainValidationProcess` (instant)

### Targeted Analysis (Loads Specific Data)
- **Single Date**: "Analyze discrepancies for 10-06-2025" → Uses `AnalyzeSpecificDate` (loads 1 simulation file)
- **Data Preview**: "Preview simulation data for 15-06-2025" → Uses `PreviewData` (loads 1 simulation file)

### Heavy Operations (Use Sparingly)
- **Full Analysis**: "Analyze all discrepancies" → Uses `AnalyzeDiscrepancies` (loads all 19 simulation files)

### Performance Tips
- Start with real-trade analysis for quick insights
- Use specific dates when comparing real vs simulation
- Cache is persistent across sessions - data loads only once
- Use `ClearCache` if you need to force data reload
